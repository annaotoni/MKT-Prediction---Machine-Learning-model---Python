# MKT Prediction | Machine Learning Model | Python

This Python script conducts an exploratory analysis and builds a linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising expenditures across different platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and newspapers. Initially, the script loads and inspects the data, displaying the first few rows and checking for missing and duplicate values. It then presents a series of visualizations, such as histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots, to analyze data distribution and explore relationships between variables.

After the exploratory analysis, the script proceeds with data preparation for modeling, dividing it into training and test sets. A linear regression model is then trained with the training data. The model's performance is evaluated using statistical metrics, such as mean squared error and the coefficient of determination (RÂ²).

Finally, the script provides a function for predicting sales based on advertising investments, and exemplifies its use with predictions for different investment amounts. This tool is useful for informed decision-making in marketing campaigns, allowing an understanding of how different levels of investment can influence sales.
